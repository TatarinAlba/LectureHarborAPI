The main idea for now lies in implementing 3 main services:
* **LectureHarborAPI** - Main service (layer with auth etc.)
* **Classifier** - AI based layer for getting full transcription of the concept of the MP3 or MP4.
* **Analyzer** - AI based layer for getting main concepts from the given transcription and generating (maybe we will 
decompose it into several layers in the future)
___
## Technical stack
### LectureHarborAPI
For the main service we have chosen **Golang** as a primary programming language for its efficiency and wide popularity.
Later we will update full descriptions of the tools used.
### Classifier 
For working with AI part we have chosen **Python**. Later we will add libraries\frameworks used in the project.
### Analyzer
This part of our AI model will be also based on **Python**. Later we will add libraries\frameworks used in.
